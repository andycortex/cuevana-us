/**
 * Apify extends the launch options of Playwright.
 * You can use any of the Playwright compatible
 * [`LaunchOptions`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browsertypelaunchoptions)
 * options by providing the `launchOptions` property.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * ```js
 * // launch a headless Chrome (not Chromium)
 * const launchContext = {
 *     // Apify helpers
 *     useChrome: true,
 *     proxyUrl: 'http://user:password@some.proxy.com'
 *     // Native Playwright options
 *     launchOptions: {
 *         headless: true,
 *         args: ['--some-flag'],
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @typedef PlaywrightLaunchContext
 * @property {LaunchOptions} [launchOptions]
 *  `browserType.launch` [options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch)
 * @property {string} [proxyUrl]
 *   URL to a HTTP proxy server. It must define the port number,
 *   and it may also contain proxy username and password.
 *
 *   Example: `http://bob:pass123@proxy.example.com:1234`.
 * @property {string} [userAgent]
 *   The `User-Agent` HTTP header used by the browser.
 *   If not provided, the function sets `User-Agent` to a reasonable default
 *   to reduce the chance of detection of the crawler.
 * @property {boolean} [useChrome=false]
 *   If `true` and `executablePath` is not set,
 *   Playwright will launch full Google Chrome browser available on the machine
 *   rather than the bundled Chromium. The path to Chrome executable
 *   is taken from the `APIFY_CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable if provided,
 *   or defaults to the typical Google Chrome executable location specific for the operating system.
 * @property {boolean} [useIncognitoPages=false]
 *   With this option selected, all pages will be opened in a new incognito browser context.
 *   This means they will not share cookies nor cache and their resources will not be throttled by one another.
 * @property {string} [userDataDir]
 *   Sets the [User Data Directory](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/user_data_dir.md) path.
 *   The user data directory contains profile data such as history, bookmarks, and cookies, as well as other per-installation local state.
 *   If not specified, a temporary directory is used instead.
 * @property {*} [launcher]
// @ts-ignore optional peer dependency
 *   By default this function uses `require("playwright").chromium`.
// @ts-ignore optional peer dependency
 *   If you want to use a different browser you can pass it by this property as e.g. `require("playwright").firefox`
